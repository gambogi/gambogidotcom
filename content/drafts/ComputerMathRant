A Review of Computer Science Education in Loudoun County
========================================================

[Blurb about why CS is important]

Let's begin at the beginning. Computer Mathematics, otherwise known as
"" to LCPS students, is the first of two official offerings in Computer Science.
As a student interested in robotics, I was unaware of any programming courses
offered by the school system. The name Computer Mathematics does not accurately
characterize the nature of the class or the value students may get out of it.

Computer Math was the class that got me started with Computer Science and
Software Engineering. At all of my jobs in the industry I have used skills I
first learned in that class. But despite it

Before taking the class, students must have taken or be taking Algebra II. This
means the earliest this class may be taken for students on a standard
progression is their Junior year of High school. Practically speaking, most
students will not be able to fit it in until that time anyway.
