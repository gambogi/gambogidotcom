title: The Economics of Compilers
---

# Introduction

In the tech sector, a substantial portion of revenue is produced by
or relies heavily upon the creation of programs; manuscripts which
tell a computer what it is that needs to be computed, and when.
This is a costly endeavor. It would be far more expensive if it were
not for a particular type of program known as a compiler. A compiler
takes in text written in some kind of programming language, and
produces something machine executable (or almost machine executable,
but that's a minor detail.) As a rule, the output of these programs is
long; far longer than the input source code. This is both labor saving,
and a lift in the quality of code. The productivity multiplier of
these programs would be hard to quantify, simply because it is so
great. Why then, are nearly all major compilers free? And why are some
for sale?

# The Beginnings

In late 1953, John Backus began work with a team of ten programmers to
develop a compiler for a high level language he had designed.
The language was FORTRAN, and it would take this team of now venerated
programmers just over 3 years to complete.
