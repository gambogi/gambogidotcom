I just finished listening to the most recent Intelligence Squared US podcast,
and it got me thinking about this concept of the Right to be Forgotten.

1) What does it mean to be a public figure
2) What benefit is there to blackholing specific search results
3) The right is both weak and onerous.
4) Why is the solution to this problem (reduction of privacy a litigous one)
5) Outlawing particular algorithims is tantamount to outlawing certain ways of thinking
