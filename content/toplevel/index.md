title: Hi
---

I'm still trying to figure out how to define myself. In the meantime, I enjoy
running,
cycling,
good friends,
good food,
good music,
and a good podcast.

Professionally, I write software with my team at Apple. I'm always happy to
discuss new opportunities, but I'm not looking for work. Although I'm fairly early
in my career if you are interested in advice feel free to reach out.
