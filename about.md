title: About
---
I'm a Computer Science and Economics Double Major at the
[Rochester Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu). Currently I am in
San Diego working for Intuit on the DAT(A)Â² Platform Engineering team.
Outside of class I spend a lot of my time tinkering on a variety of pet
projects, some of which you can find on my [github](https://github.com/gambogi).
I'm also a runner, and usually can be found somewhere within a 10 mile radius of
campus. I'm interested in the applications of mathematics, economics, computer
science. Less formally I read about biology, sociology, political science,
and anything else worth writing books on.
