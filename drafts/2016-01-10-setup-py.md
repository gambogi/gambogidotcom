title: How I package Pythons
tags: python

Disclaimers up front: I've never used [conda][1], so it is concievable
that it solves some of the problems I will discuss in this post. It's entirely
possible it even solves them in a better ways.

With that said, this is how I write a `setup.py` for use with `pip`.

``` Python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='package-name-here',

    version=open('VERSION').readline().strip(),

    author='AUTHOR NAME HERE',

    author_email='AUTHOR@EMAIL.HERE',

    packages=find_packages(exclude=['*tests*']),

    include_package_data=True,

    description='SHORT DESCRIPTION HERE',

    long-description=open('README.md').read(),

    install_requires=open('requirements.txt').readlines()
)
```
