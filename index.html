<p>
I am a double major in Computer Science and Economics at the
<a href="https://rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.
</p><p>
I'm interested in type systems, market structures,
static analysis, and the organization of people, among other
things.
</p><p>
I am a runner and cyclist (some time triathlete). Currently (2015), a summary of my logs may be found
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/3997620">here</a>.
</p><p>
Tinkerings from my free time may be found on my
<a href="https://www.github.com/gambogi">Github</a>.

<p>Here is a list of some of my recent posts:</p>
