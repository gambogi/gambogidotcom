			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I’m a Computer Science and Economics Double Major at the <a href="https://rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>. Currently I am in San Diego working for Intuit on the DAT(A)² Platform Engineering team. Outside of class I spend a lot of my time tinkering on a variety of pet projects, some of which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/gambogi">github</a>. I’m also a runner, and usually can be found somewhere within a 10 mile radius of campus. I’m interested in the applications of mathematics, economics, computer science. Less formally I read about biology, sociology, political science, and anything else worth writing books on.</p>
