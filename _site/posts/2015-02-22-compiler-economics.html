<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In the tech sector, a substantial portion of revenue is produced by or relies heavily upon the creation of programs; manuscripts which tell a computer what it is that needs to be computed, and when. This is a costly endeavor. It would be far more expensive if it were not for a particular type of program known as a compiler. A compiler takes in text written in some kind of programming language, and produces something machine executable (or almost machine executable, but thatâ€™s a minor detail.) As a rule, the output of these programs is long; far longer than the input source code. This is both labor saving, and a lift in the quality of code. The productivity multiplier of these programs would be hard to quantify, simply because it is so great. Why then, are nearly all major compilers free? And why are some for sale?</p>
<h1 id="the-beginnings">The Beginnings</h1>
<p>In late 1953, John Backus began work with a team of ten programmers to develop a compiler for a high level language he had designed. The language was FORTRAN, and it would take this team of now venerated programmers just over 3 years to complete.</p>
